# New State

When a process is first created, it enters the **New** state.

## Key Points
- Process is being set up in memory.
- OS allocates resources (memory, PCB, I/O).
- Process is not yet ready for execution.

## Example
When you launch an application, the OS loads its program into memory but does not execute it immediately.

## Transition
- From **New** â†’ **Ready**: After all resources are allocated and process is fully initialized.
