# Pipes

## What is a Pipe?
- **Unidirectional communication** between processes
- One process writes → another reads

### Types
- **Anonymous Pipes** → Between parent-child processes
- **Named Pipes (FIFOs)** → Between independent processes

## Example
Linux command chaining: `ls | grep "txt"`

## Analogy
A **water pipe** flowing in one direction.
