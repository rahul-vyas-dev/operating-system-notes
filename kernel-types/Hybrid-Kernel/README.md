# Hybrid Kernel

A **Hybrid Kernel** combines elements of monolithic and microkernel designs.  
It runs some services in kernel mode for performance, while others run in user space for stability.

## Advantages
- Balanced performance and stability
- More flexible than a pure monolithic kernel

## Disadvantages
- Still complex to design and maintain

## Examples
- Windows NT
- XNU (macOS, iOS)
