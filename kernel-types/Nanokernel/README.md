A **Nanokernel** is an extremely small kernel that only provides the most basic hardware abstraction and scheduling functions.  
Other features must be implemented in user space.

## Advantages
- Very lightweight
- Ideal for embedded systems

## Disadvantages
- Requires additional software to be functional

## Examples
- Some embedded system kernels
