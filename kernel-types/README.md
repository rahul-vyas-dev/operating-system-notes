# Types of Kernels in Operating Systems

The **kernel** is the core part of an operating system.  
It manages communication between **hardware** and **software** and controls resources like CPU, memory, and devices.

Different operating systems use different kernel designs based on performance, security, and architecture needs.

## Types of Kernels

1. [Monolithic Kernel](Monolithic-Kernel) – All OS services run in kernel space.
2. [Microkernel](Microkernel) – Minimal services in kernel; rest run in user space.
3. [Hybrid Kernel](Hybrid-Kernel) – Mix of monolithic and microkernel features.
4. [Nanokernel](Nanokernel) – Extremely small kernel with minimal functions.
5. [Exokernel](Exokernel) – Gives maximum control to user applications.
