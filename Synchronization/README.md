# Synchronization in Operating Systems

## Overview
Synchronization in Operating Systems ensures that **multiple processes or threads** can **access shared resources** without causing **data inconsistency**.  
It is essential in **multithreading** and **multiprocessing** environments.

---

## Why Synchronization is Needed?
- **Prevent Race Conditions** – When two or more processes access shared data at the same time, the final result depends on the order of execution.  
- **Maintain Data Consistency** – Ensure the data remains correct and predictable.  
- **Coordinate Tasks** – Some tasks must happen in a specific order.

## Summary
Synchronization is **key to preventing data corruption** and **ensuring predictable execution** in multi-threaded or multi-process environments.  
Common tools: **Mutex, Semaphore, Monitors**.  
Without it → **Race conditions, deadlocks, data loss**.
