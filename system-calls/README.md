# System Calls in Operating Systems

A **System Call** is the mechanism through which a program requests a service from the operating system's kernel.  
It acts as an interface between the **user programs** and the **OS**.

System calls allow user-level processes to access OS resources like files, devices, and processes.

## Categories of System Calls

1. [Process Control](create-process.md) – Creating, terminating, or managing processes.
2. [File Management](file-management.md) – Creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.
3. [Device Management](device-management.md) – Requesting or releasing device access.
4. [Information Maintenance](information-maintenance.md) – Getting or setting system data.
5. [Communication](communication.md) – Sending/receiving data between processes.
