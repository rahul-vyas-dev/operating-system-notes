# ðŸ“˜ I/O Management in Operating System

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction
**I/O Management** in an Operating System deals with handling **input/output devices** (like keyboard, mouse, disk, printer, network cards) and coordinating their operations with the CPU and memory.  

Since I/O devices are slower than CPU and memory, efficient management is required to reduce CPU idle time and improve system performance.

## ðŸ”¹ Objectives of I/O Management
- âœ… Provide **abstraction** â€“ hide hardware complexity.  
- âœ… Ensure **efficient CPU utilization** (CPU should not always wait for I/O).  
- âœ… Provide **fair access** to multiple processes.  
- âœ… Handle **errors and failures** in devices gracefully.

##  Types of I/O Devices
- **Character Devices** â†’ Keyboard, mouse, printer (stream of characters).  
- **Block Devices** â†’ Hard disk, SSD (fixed-size blocks of data).  
- **Network Devices** â†’ Network Interface Cards (NICs).

##  I/O Techniques

### 1. **Programmed I/O**
- CPU continuously checks (polls) device until I/O completes.  
-  CPU time is wasted.  
- Example: Polling keyboard input.  

---

### 2. **Interrupt-Driven I/O**
- Device sends an **interrupt signal** to CPU when ready.  
-  CPU can do other tasks in the meantime.  
- Example: Keyboard generates interrupt when a key is pressed.  

---

### 3. **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**
- Special **DMA controller** transfers data directly between memory and I/O device.  
-  CPU is free for other work.  
- Example: Disk transferring data directly into RAM.

##  I/O Buffering
Used to **match speed differences** between fast CPU/memory and slower I/O devices.  

- **Single Buffering** â†’ One buffer between process and device.  
- **Double Buffering** â†’ Two buffers, while one is filled the other is emptied.  
- **Circular Buffering** â†’ Multiple buffers in a circular queue.  

---

##  I/O Spooling
**SPOOL = Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line**  

- Uses **disk as a buffer** to hold output for slow devices (e.g., printer).  
- Example: Multiple print jobs stored in a spool, printer processes them one by one.  

---

##  I/O Scheduling
- Decides the **order of I/O operations** when multiple requests exist.  
- Improves throughput and reduces waiting.  
- Example: Disk Scheduling (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN).
