# Burst Time (BT)

**Burst Time** is the total time a process requires to execute on the CPU.

- Also called **Execution Time** or **Running Time**
- Measured in milliseconds (ms)
- Includes only CPU execution time, not I/O time

**Example:**
If a process needs 5 ms to complete execution, BT = 5 ms.
