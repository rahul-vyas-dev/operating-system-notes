# Logical Address

## üìñ Definition

A **Logical Address** (also known as **Virtual Address**) is the address generated by the **CPU** during program execution.  
It is the address a program uses to access memory, but it does not directly correspond to the physical memory.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Points

- Generated by the **CPU**.
- Used by the program (user view).
- Needs to be mapped to a **Physical Address** by the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**.
- Also called **virtual address**.

---

## üñ• Example

Suppose a program tries to access memory at location **0x0050**.  
This is the **logical address**.

The MMU translates this into a physical address, e.g., **0x1050** in RAM.

## Analogy

Think of a logical address as your **nickname**.  
Your friends call you by your nickname, but the government identifies you by your **official name (physical address)**.
