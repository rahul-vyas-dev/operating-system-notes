# Memory Addresses in Operating System

In Operating Systems, **addresses** play an important role in memory management.  
There are two main types of addresses:

- [Logical Address](./logical_address/README.md)  
- [Physical Address](./physical_address/README.md)  

Both are essential in understanding how a program interacts with memory.
