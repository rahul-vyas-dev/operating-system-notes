# Physical Address

## 📖 Definition
A **Physical Address** is the actual location in the **main memory (RAM)**.  
It is the real address that the hardware (memory unit) uses to access data.

---

## ⚙️ Key Points
- Generated by the **MMU** after translating the logical address.
- Represents the actual location in **RAM**.
- Used by the **hardware** (not directly by the program).

---

## 🖥 Example
If the logical address is **0x0050**,  
and the MMU adds a relocation offset of **0x1000**,  
then the **Physical Address = 0x1050** in RAM.

## 📊 Diagram: Address Mapping with Offset

Logical Address: 0x0050
Base (Relocation Register): 0x1000

Physical Address = 0x1000 + 0x0050 = 0x1050


---

## 🔑 Analogy
Think of a physical address as your **home address**.  
The delivery person (hardware) uses your exact home address to deliver items, not your nickname.
