# Fixed Partition Allocation

In Fixed Partition Allocation:
- Memory is divided into **fixed-size** partitions during system startup.
- Each partition holds **only one process**.
- If a process is smaller than the partition, the extra space is wasted (**internal fragmentation**).

## Example:
RAM = 1000 KB, divided into 4 partitions of 250 KB each:
- Process A = 200 KB → fits in one partition (50 KB wasted)
- Process B = 300 KB → cannot fit (partition too small)

## Advantages:
- Simple to implement.
- Low overhead.

## Disadvantages:
- Internal fragmentation.
- Process size limited to partition size.
