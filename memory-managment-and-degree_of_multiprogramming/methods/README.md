# Memory Management in Operating Systems

## Brief Introduction

Memory Management is an essential function of an operating system that manages the allocation and deallocation of memory to various running processes. It ensures that each process has sufficient memory to execute while maintaining system stability and efficiency. Proper memory management improves CPU utilization and avoids conflicts or memory wastage.

## Types of Memory Management

1. [Contiguous Memory Management](./contiguous_memory_management)  
   Memory is allocated in a single continuous block for each process. This method is simple but can suffer from fragmentation issues.

2. [Non-Contiguous Memory Management](./non_contiguous_memory_management)  
   Memory is allocated in separate blocks, allowing better utilization and flexibility. Techniques include paging and segmentation.
