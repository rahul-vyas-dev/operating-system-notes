# Clustered Operating System

A Clustered Operating System is a type of operating system that manages a group of independent computers (called nodes) to work together as a single system. It coordinates tasks across multiple machines to provide better performance, fault tolerance, and high availability.

Clustered systems are commonly used in environments where system failure cannot be tolerated and where high-speed processing is required.

## Key Concept

- A cluster consists of **two or more computers (nodes)** connected via a network.
- All nodes **work together** and are managed by a single Clustered OS.
- The system **distributes tasks** across nodes for performance or redundancy.
- If one node fails, **other nodes take over** the tasks (failover support).

## How It Works

1. Multiple independent systems (nodes) are connected using a network.
2. Each node has its own OS, but the Clustered OS manages communication and coordination between them.
3. When a task is submitted, it is either divided among the nodes or assigned to the most suitable one.
4. If one node fails, the Clustered OS reassigns its tasks to other nodes.
5. All nodes share data through a shared file system or database.

## Example Scenario

Consider a web hosting company:
- Node A handles web traffic.
- Node B processes background reports.
- Node C stores and serves media files.

If Node A fails, the Clustered OS transfers its load to Node B or C temporarily to keep the system running smoothly.

## Features

- High system availability and reliability.
- Distributed load balancing.
- Nodes can be added or removed without shutting down the system.
- Centralized management of resources.

## Advantages

- Improved performance through parallel processing.
- High fault tolerance: failure of one node doesnâ€™t crash the system.
- Scalable system: easy to add more nodes.
- Resource sharing improves overall system efficiency.

## Disadvantages

- Complex to configure and manage.
- Requires high-speed network and reliable communication.
- Nodes must be compatible in terms of software and hardware.
- Synchronization and data consistency can be challenging.

## Requirements

- A network to interconnect all cluster nodes.
- Shared storage or communication mechanism (e.g., NAS or SAN).
- Software for clustering and load balancing (e.g., Microsoft Cluster Server, Linux HA).
- Redundant hardware for high availability.

## Summary

- A Clustered OS coordinates multiple computers to work as one system.
- It enhances system availability, fault tolerance, and performance.
- Commonly used in servers, cloud infrastructure, and high-performance computing.
- Requires careful planning and management to function correctly.
