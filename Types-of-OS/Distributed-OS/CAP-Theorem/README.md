# CAP Theorem in Distributed Systems  

Distributed systems are everywhere â€” from cloud databases to microservices. But they come with trade-offs that developers must understand. Thatâ€™s where the **CAP Theorem** comes in.  

---

## ðŸ”‘ What is CAP Theorem?  
CAP stands for:  
- **C â€“ Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write.  
- **A â€“ Availability**: Every request gets a response (success/failure).  
- **P â€“ Partition Tolerance**: The system continues working even if parts of the network fail.  

ðŸ‘‰ The theorem states that **a distributed system can only guarantee two of the three properties at the same time**.

## âš¡ The Trade-offs  
- **CA (Consistency + Availability)**  
  Works well until a network partition occurs. Rare in large real-world systems.  

- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**  
  Prioritizes correctness of data. Example: **MongoDB** (when configured for strong consistency).  

- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**  
  Keeps services running even if some data is stale. Example: **Cassandra**, **DynamoDB**.

## ðŸ›  Example  
Imagine a distributed database spread across multiple servers.  
If the network splits (partition):  
- Choosing **Consistency** â†’ some requests fail, but data stays correct.  
- Choosing **Availability** â†’ all requests succeed, but some data may be outdated.

## ðŸš€ Why It Matters?  
Whenever you design a **database, cache, or API at scale**, youâ€™ll face CAP trade-offs.  
Understanding it helps you pick the right architecture for your project.
